# Smart-Cane
 The project is a smart cane designed to help visually impaired people walk without any problem.
This cane has two ultrasonic sensors: one on the front which emits a sound that repeats depending on the proximity of the obstacle and another below which triggers a vibrator in the handle when a hole is detected, like a staircase.
